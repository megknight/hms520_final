## Introduction: 
IHME’s resource tracking team lies at the intersection of economics and global health. As a result, much of the team’s research integrates elements from both of these fields. Economics researchers predominately utilize STATA; however, IHME is actively transitioning away from STATA for a multitude of reasons including cost, speed, and collaboration. The resource tracking team’s flagship project, the development assistance for health (DAH) project, involves many interconnected pipelines with tens of thousands of lines of STATA code. To transition this project out of STATA into R, a concerted effort is necessary. For our final project, we will be working on converting a series of data preparation and processing scripts from one channel’s pipeline into R.

Introduction: 
As a result of this project, we established a precedent for translating scripts between coding languages by setting a standard for code construction and readability.  ADD A SENTENCE SAYING WE TRANSLATED X SCRIPTS FROM FOUNDATIONS PIPELINE THAT DO Y.
